# Functions & Analysis

Hello All! 

This repository serves as a Portfolio Project to demonstrate my understanding of mathematical functions and analysis using python. It is kept simple and understandable, with all of the code explained by me in comments, so that everyone can read it in one go without having to guess or assume what I was trying to do there. 

Main topics covered here are:
- Linear equations. Finding the x-intercept and how to plot the graph
- Quadratic equations. Finding the derivative and plot the function and the derivative simultaneously.
- Exponential equations. Same here, plotting the function and its derivative.
- Integral Calculus. Finding the Area under the curve using SymPy. We take a quadratic equation and plot its area under the curve! 

I hope you will enjoy this little project and I will be happy to talk more about it :) 

Bye, Amin
